# Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
#
# There are 7 arithmetic operators in Python :
# Addition
# Subtraction
# Multiplication
# Division
# Modulus
# Exponentiation
# Floor division

# 1. Addition Operator: In Python, + is the addition operator. It is used to add 2 values.
# 2. Subtraction Operator : In Python, – is the subtraction operator. It is used to subtract the second value from the first value.
# 3. Multiplication Operator : In Python, * is the multiplication operator. It is used to find the product of 2 values.
# 4. Division Operator : In Python, / is the division operator. It is used to find the quotient when first operand is divided by the second.
# 5. Modulus Operator : In Python, % is the modulus operator. It is used to find the remainder when first operand is divided by the second.
# 6. Exponentiation Operator : In Python, ** is the exponentiation operator. It is used to raise the first operand to power of second.
# 7. Floor division : In Python, // is used to conduct the floor division. It is used to find the floor of the quotient when first operand is divided by the second.


# Below is the summary of all 7 operators :
#
# Operator	Description	Syntax
# +	Addition: adds two operands	x + y
# –	Subtraction: subtracts two operands	x – y
# *	Multiplication: multiplies two operands	x * y
# /	Division (float): divides the first operand by the second	x / y
# //	Division (floor): divides the first operand by the second	x // y
# %	Modulus: returns the remainder when first operand is divided by the second	x % y
# **	Power : Returns first raised to power second	x ** y
