# Python Lists are just like dynamically sized arrays, declared in other languages (vector in C++ and ArrayList in Java).
# In simple language, a list is a collection of things, enclosed in [ ] and separated by commas.
#The list is a sequence data type which is used to store the collection of data. Tuples and String are other types of sequence data types.
